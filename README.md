# SharkblockX

SharkblockX is a PHP framework experiment I'm developing to make front-end web development simpler for my personal projects by substituting markup with PHP functionality, freeing you from the 'garbage code mess' of WYSIWYG software like Dreamweaver.! It enforces a simplistic yet effective 'block-like' page structure and layout inspired by Semantic UI. SharkblockX is a total rewrite of my earlier [KAblockX](https://github.com/SharktasticA/KAblockX), which after a brief public development cycle, I moved to updating the code privately and is now very much out of date. SharkblockX is being developed to replace this privately customised version of KAblockX used for my main website project - [Admiral Shark's Keyboards](https://sharktastica.co.uk/).

That said, this is note intended for use within production or critical environments. The code is developed with my own websites in mind, thus it's only published in case it can be of use for others' personal projects.
